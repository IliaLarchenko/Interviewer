# Welcome to the AI Mock Interviewer!

You can try this service in the demo mode here: [AI Interviewer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IliaLarchenko/interviewer).

But for the good experience you need to run it locally [Project repository](https://github.com/IliaLarchenko/Interviewer).

This tool is designed to help you practice various technical interviews by simulating real interview experiences. 
You can enhance your skills in coding, (machine learning) system design, and other topics. 
You can brush your interview skills in a realistic setting, although itâ€™s not intended to replace thorough preparations like studying algorithms or practicing coding problems.

## Key Features

- **Speech-First Interface**: Talk to the AI just like you would with a real interviewer. This makes your practice sessions feel more realistic.
- **Various AI Models**: The tool uses three types of AI models:
  - **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Acts as the interviewer.
  - **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Models**: These models help to mimic real conversations by converting spoken words to text and vice versa.
- **Model Flexibility**: You can use many different models, including those from OpenAI, open-source models from Hugging Face, and locally running models.
- **Streaming Mode**: All models can be used in streaming mode. Instead of waiting for the full response from the AI, you can get partial responses in real-time.


# Running the AI Tech Interviewer Simulator

To get the real experience you should run the AI interviewer locally and use your own API key or local model.

## Initial Setup

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IliaLarchenko/Interviewer
cd interviewer
```

### Configure the Environment

Create a `.env` file from the provided Open AI example and edit it to include your OpenAI API key (learn how to get it here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys):

```bash
cp .env.openai.example .env
nano .env  # You can use any text editor
```

If you want to use any other model, follow the instructions in Models Configuration section.

### Build and Run the Docker Container

To build and start the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:7860`.

### Running Locally (alternative)

If you don't want to use Docker just set up a Python environment and install dependencies to run the application locally:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:7860`.


# Models Configuration

AI Interviewer is powered by three types of AI models: a Large Language Model (LLM) for simulating interviews, a Speech-to-Text (STT) model for audio processing, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to read LLM responses. You can configure each model separately to tailor the experience based on your preferences and available resources.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

- **OpenAI Models**: You can use models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o or others provided by OpenAI. Set up is straightforward with your OpenAI API key.
- **Hugging Face Models**: Models like Meta-Llama from Hugging Face can also be integrated. Make sure your API key has appropriate permissions.
- **Claude**: You can use models from Anthropic, such as Claude, for a different interview experience. Ensure you have the necessary API key and permissions.
- **Local Models**: If you have the capability, you can run models locally using Ollama or other tools. Ensure they are compatible with the Open AI or Hugging Face API for seamless integration.

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

- **OpenAI Whisper**: Available via OpenAI, this model supports multiple languages and dialects. It is also available in an open-source version on Hugging Face, giving you the flexibility to use it either through the OpenAI API or as a locally hosted version.
- **Other OS models**: Can be used too but can require a specific wrapper to align with API requirements.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

- **OpenAI Models**: The "tts-1" model from OpenAI is fast and produces human-like results, making it quite convenient for this use case.
- **Other OS models**: Can be used too but can require a specific wrapper to align with API requirements. In my experience, OS models sound more robotic than OpenAI models.

## Configuration via .env File

The tool uses a `.env` file for environment configuration. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how this works:

- **API Keys**: Whether using OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other services, your API key must be specified in the `.env` file. This key should have the necessary permissions to access the models you intend to use.
- **Model URLs and Types**: Specify the API endpoint URLs for each model and their type (e.g., `OPENAI_API` for OpenAI models, `HF_API` for Hugging Face or local APIs).
- **Model Names**: Set the specific model name, such as `gpt-4o` or `whisper-1`, to tell the application which model to interact with.

### Example Configuration

OpenAI LLM:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
LLM_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_TYPE=OPENAI_API
LLM_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Claude LLM:
```plaintext
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
LLM_TYPE=ANTHROPIC_API
LLM_NAME=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
```

Hugging face TTS:
```plaintext
HF_API_KEY=hf_YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
TTS_URL=https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/mms-tts-eng
TTS_TYPE=HF_API
TTS_NAME=Facebook-mms-tts-eng
```

Local STT:
```plaintext
HF_API_KEY=None
STT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/transcribe
STT_TYPE=HF_API
STT_NAME=whisper-base.en
```

You can configure each models separately. Find more examples in the `.env.example` files provided.

# Acknowledgements

The service is powered by Gradio, and the demo version is hosted on HuggingFace Spaces.

Even though the service can be used with great variety of models I want to specifically acknowledge a few of them:
- **OpenAI**: For models like GPT, Whisper, and TTS-1. More details on their models and usage policies can be found at [OpenAI's website](https://www.openai.com).
- **Meta**: For the Llama models, particularly the Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, as well as Facebook-mms-tts-eng model. Visit [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com) for more information.
- **HuggingFace**: For a wide range of models and APIs that greatly enhance the flexibility of this tool. For specific details on usage, refer to [Hugging Face's documentation](https://huggingface.co).

Please ensure to review the specific documentation and follow the terms of service for each model and API you use, as this is crucial for responsible and compliant use of these technologies.
